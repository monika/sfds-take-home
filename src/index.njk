  <h3>What will fellows work on?</h3>

  <p>
    SFDigital fellows will work with the city to improve public services. They
    use technology to make it easier for people to get things done.
  </p>
  <p>
    Fellows work on critical issues like affordable housing, small businesses,
    legal aid for immigrants, and more. They are also helping to rebuild the
    city’s website from the ground up. This means taking a service-led
    approach so that anyone using the site can get what they need.
  </p>
  <p>
    As an SFDigital Fellow, you will re-think how public services are
    designed, by understanding what our users need and building with an agile
    approach.
