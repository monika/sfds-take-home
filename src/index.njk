  <h3>What will fellows work on?</h3>

  <p>
    SFDigital fellows will work with the city to improve public services. They
    use technology to make it easier for people to get things done.
  </p>
  <p>
    Fellows work on critical issues like affordable housing, small businesses,
    legal aid for immigrants, and more. They are also helping to rebuild the
    cityâ€™s website from the ground up. This means taking a service-led
    approach so that anyone using the site can get what they need.
  </p>
  <p>
    As an SFDigital Fellow, you will re-think how public services are
    designed, by understanding what our users need and building with an agile
    approach.
